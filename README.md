# DialogueManagementScript
A scripting language for managing dialogue for an upcoming project I am working on

The final version of the interperter will most likely be built in c++ and compiled as a dll. The syntax of the DMS will be very similar to the parseManager syntax I am working on. This will eventually replace the parseManager code. There are a few differences that will make old code incompatable with the new interpreter, but converting old code should be fairly simple to do. Not too much has changed.
